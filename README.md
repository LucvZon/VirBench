# Introduction
VirBench (Viral Assembly Benchmark) is a scalable and reproducible Snakemake workflow designed to benchmark the performance of various long-read assemblers on viral metagenomic Nanopore data.

VirBench employs a "semi-targeted" multi-tier assembly strategy to maximize genome recovery and compare tool performance across different levels of complexity.

# Key Features

- **Targeted Read Filtering**:
	- Pre-filters raw Nanopore reads using a custom protein database (e.g., all human viruses) to enrich for sequences of interest.
- **Multi-Tier Assembly Strategy**:
	- **Primary**: Individual de novo assemblies from multiple state-of-the-art tools.
    - **Secondary (Reassembly)**: Merging all primary contigs and re-assembling them to improve continuity.
    - **Final**: A hybrid assembly combining re-assembled contigs with unique, clustered contigs from the primary pool (via [MMseqs2](https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2)).
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Automated benchmarking of all three tiers using:
 	- **Reference-Free:** ([CheckV](https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/checkv)) for completeness and quality.
    - **Reference-Based:** ([QUAST](https://github.com/ablab/quast)) for accuracy against specific viruses of interest.

This workflow is designed to help researchers evaluate which assembly tool is most appropriate for their data, especially in scenarios where reliable reference genomes are unavailable or highly diverse.

# How to run

Clone the repo and install the required conda environment:

```
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/LucvZon/VirBench.git

cd VirBench

# Install environment
conda env create -f env/environment.yml

# Activate environment
conda activate virbench
```

## Setup configuration

VirBench relies on `config/virbench.yml` to find input fastq data, databases, references and more.

Key sections to adjust:

- `Sample Configuration`: Choose a sample name and supply a path to its corresponding fastq.gz files.
- `External Databases`: Set the paths for the diamond and checkv databases.
- `Virus Selection`: Fill in a species name and its corresponding FASTA reference file.

Optional sections:

- `Assembler Selection`: Turn assemblers on/off.
- `General Parameters`: Adjust number of threads and specific tool parameters

**config/virbench.yml**:

```
Adjust --cores 24 if necessary. 

# Workflow

### 1. Read Preparation & QC
- **Input**: Raw FASTQ files for a sample.
- **Process**:
	- -> Merge all raw reads.
	- -> Trim adapters and low-quality ends ([cutadapt](https://github.com/marcelm/cutadapt)).
	- -> Perform quality filtering ([fastplong](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastplong)).
- **Output**: One cleaned FASTQ file per sample.

### 2. Targeted Read Filtering
- **Input**: The cleaned FASTQ file.
- **Process**:
	- -> Classify reads against a protein database (e.g., all viral proteins) using [DIAMOND](https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond) BLASTX.
	- -> Extract only the reads that hit the database.
- **Output**: A smaller FASTQ file containing only the reads of interest ("target reads").

### 3. Denovo Assembly
- **Input**: The "target reads" FASTQ file.
- **Process**: The same set of target reads is given to each active assembler.
- **Output**: Multiple raw assembly files (one FASTA per assembler).

### 4. Contig Annotation
- **Input**: The raw assembly files from each assembler.
- **Process**:
	- -> Contigs from all assemblers are collected and annotated against the protein database (DIAMOND).
	- -> A custom script post-processes the results to assign the best taxonomic lineage to each contig.
- **Output**: An annotated table (TSV) for each assembly, linking contigs to potential viruses.

### 5. Per-Assembler Evaluation
- (These steps run independently for each assembler's output to assess its individual quality)
- **Process**:
	- -> General Stats: Calculate basic assembly metrics (N50, total length, etc.).
	- -> Read Mapping: Map all high-quality reads back to the assembly to check coverage.
	- -> Viral QC: Run CheckV to estimate viral genome completeness and check for contamination.
- Output: Individual quality reports and statistics for each assembly.

### 6. Targeted Comparative Analysis
- (This final stage brings the results together for a direct comparison on specific viruses of interest)
- **Process**:
	- -> Binning: Based on the annotations, contigs are binned into separate FASTA files by virus species.
	- -> Comparative QUAST: For each virus of interest (e.g., Monkeypox virus), the binned contigs from all assemblers are compared against the official reference genome.
	- -> Contig Mapping: The binned contigs are also mapped to the reference genome to visualize alignment.
- **Output**: A final, comparative QUAST report showing which assembler performed best for each targeted virus.

### 7. Report summary
- A Quarto book is rendered into results/report/final_summary_report/index.html.

# Outputs

- `results/1_quality_control/`: Cleaned FASTQ files.
- `results/3_assemblies/`: Raw outputs for Primary tools.
- `results/4_reassemblies/`: Outputs for Secondary re-assemblies.
- `results/6_final_assembly/`: The integrated Final assembly files.
- `results/8_stats_and_qc/`: Detailed CheckV, QUAST, and mapping logs.
- `results/report/final_summary_report/`: The interactive HTML benchmark report.

# Databases

VirBench requires two external databases:
1. [DIAMOND](https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond/wiki): A protein database (e.g., RVDB or NCBI Viral) formatted with diamond makedb.
2. [CheckV](https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/checkv): The standard CheckV database.
